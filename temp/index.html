    <p>Keeping bees can be a very rewarding and fun hobby. To properly care for your bees, you need to make sure they are healthy, properly reproducing, and are comfortable. To ensure these things are true, you need to check your hive occasionally. Every check, you should look for eggs and larvae to make sure the queen is good, clean out any extra wax, check for illness, and add more space if needed. </p>

    <h2>Honey</h2>


    <p>There are three main types of honey</p>

    <ul class="reg">
      <li class="regular">liquid honey</li>
      <li class="regular">chunk honey</li>
      <li class="regular">whipped honey</li>
    </ul>

<br>
    <p>Each honey had a different flavour and texture. These arent the only types, but they are the most common. Liquid honey is the best if you want the raw taste of honey, or if you want to drizzel it over something. Chunk honey can really trell you the personality of the hive, as it has a square of honey comb floating in it, adding new flavor. whip0ped honey has undergone controlled sugar crystalyzation and airation, leaving it white and creamy. </p>
